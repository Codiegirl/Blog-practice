            `European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA ) ecma is a standards 
            organization for information and communication systems. As a consequence, 
            the name is no longer considered an acronym and no longer uses full capitalization.
            The organization, located in Geneva, was founded in 1961 with the goal 
            to standardize computer systems in Europe. Ecma is a membership-based organization. 
            Membership is open worldwide to large and small companies that produce, 
            develop or market computer and/or communication systems.
            Ecma aims to: 
            Develop standards and tech reports to help standardize the use of consumer 
            electronics and information communication technology 
            Encourage the proper use of standards by influencing the environment where they are applied
            Publish these standards and reports in electronic and printed form.
            
            ECMAScript 
            is a scripting language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 
            and ISO/IEC 16262 (International Organization for Standardization - 16262:XXXX is 
            the identifier given by ISO/IEC where XXXX is the year of the revision). 
            Often abbreviated to ES, it was created to standardize JavaScript, and to 
            foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known 
            implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first introduced, with other well-known 
            implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is most commonly used for 
            client-side-scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is steadily being used for writing 
            server applications and services using Node.js.
            JavaScript
            JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, of Netscape, in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. 
            Eich originally joined Netscape intending to put Scheme ( a programming language that supports multiple pardigms) 
            "in the browser" but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble Java. 
            The result was a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object orientation of Self, 
            and the syntax of Java. The first version was completed in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 
            2.0 Beta release schedule, and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and later JavaScript 
            in the same month. 
            ECMAScript is the official name of the language JavaScript. The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between 
            the Netscape and Microsoft organizations involved in standardizing the language. "ECMAScript" was always 
            an unwanted trade name because they thought it sounded like a skin disease! From 2015 ECMAScript is named 
            by year (ECMAScript 2015). The latest (nine, ES2018) was available in June 2018.`,
